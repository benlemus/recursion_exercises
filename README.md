# Recursion Exercise

solved a series of problems using recursion including

    - getting a product of a list of nums
    - getting the longest word from a list of strings
    - getting every other character from a string
    - checking if a string is a palindrome
    - finding the index of a string in a list
    - reversing a string and extracting strings from a given object

Also used recursion to complete:

    - binary search
    - balanced brackets
    - split squares
